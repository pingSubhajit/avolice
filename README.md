# Avolice

**Avolice** is an AI-first personal orchestration agent that turns routines into **nested, rule-driven workflows** and keeps them aligned with your real calendar, so you always know the **next action** even when the day changes.

### What we’re building

- **Mobile-first** (React Native/Expo) with a **minimal web UI**
- **Routine engine**: nested steps, conditional logic, “hard constraints”
- **Calendar harmonization**: plan against Google/Outlook calendars (writeback is optional and only writes Avolice blocks)
- **AI-first interaction**: text chat + tool-driven UI, voice later
